There are three steps to complete the project:

1. Idea approval
2. Data collection and submission on the portal
3. Final analysis and report creation
After completing all of these steps, you will sit for the VIVA, which is the final step of the project.

For projects, there are cycles for completing steps 1, 2, and 3. First, we need to decide on a business model between B2C and B2B.

I have decided to pursue a B2C business model. Today, I will be asking a few people to share their business insights with me. I will finalize my approach based on their feedback.
